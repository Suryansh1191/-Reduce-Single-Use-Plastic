    <h1>Reduce Single-Use Plastic</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h2>1. Fix your caffeine fix</h2>
    <div>Carry a reusable coffee cup or flask. Around 2.5bn coffee cups are thrown away every year in the <br> UK alone – that’s seven million a day! Less than 1% of these can be recycled, meaning most spend up to 50 <br> years in landfill, after lasting just minutes in your hand. Lots of coffee outlets offer a discount when you use your own cup and <br> there are many eco-friendly options out there. Why not go for a WWF keepcup?</div>

    <h2>2. Bring your own bottle</h2>
    <div>Plastic bottles are one of the most frequently found items on beach cleans globally. The lids commonly end up in seabirds’ stomachs.</div>
    <h2>3. Say no to plastic cutlery</h2>
    <div>By carrying a spork, reusing your plastic cutlery or going for a compostable alternative, you could personally save 466 items of unnecessary plastic every year. It’s thought that we use plastic cutlery for just 3 minutes before throwing it away!</div>

    <h2>4. Straws suck.</h2>
    <div>
        Straws are sucking the life out of our oceans. But there is an easy fix to this one, if you don’t need one, don’t use one. Plastic straws and stirrers can take up to 200 years to decompose. Opt for paper straws or ditch them altogether and try the age-old sipping technique. Is it really worth taking a plastic straw with your Strawberry Daiquiri when the straw could remain in landfill long after your 100th birthday?</div>
    <br>
    <h2>5. Ditch the cling wrap    </h2>
    <div>Unlike cling film that cannot be recycled, foil is recyclable. So if you are using foil, make sure you put it in the recycling bin after use! Another alternative is the new Beeswax Wraps. Made using 100% cotton, Pine Resin, Jojoba Oil and local Beeswax they are 100% natural and environmentally friendly. This means no nasties will leach into your food whilst it’s stored, they’re reusable and compostable. Plus, they come in fun patterns!</div>
